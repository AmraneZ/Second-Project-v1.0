For this university project we had to work on:

- Writing a resident program that should be hidden from the task manager and the list of running processes.
- This program must do manipulations on the user's hard disk and must be launched automatically at each startup of the machine.
- Perform an installation procedure simulation.
- Create a detection program.

A big to my teacher mr A.B and to my colleagues who managed to work with me on this university project.

ps: More details about the implementation may be added soon !
